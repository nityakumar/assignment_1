           After World War II, women started to be like, 'Oh!<br> Maybe I can get a Job and tell my husband to<br> stop raping me!' They began taking on subtler <br>forms of sexism and misogyny–things that<br>might not be legally mandated (like voting<br> rights) but were fucking up women's lives none-<br>theless. These women would become the sec-<br>ond-wavers. In 1963. Betty Friedman made every<br>one go crazy by suggesting that the nuclear family might be a crock of shit that stifled wom-<br>en's potential and made them unhappy. Then<br>soooo many things happened!!! Birth control<br>pills. Illegalization of marital rape, The Equal <br> Rights Amendment did not pass. Women <br> continued to fight. because women are awesome.
