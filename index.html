            Feminism is not a radical movement or a fringe movement or an embarrassment or a fraud. <br>Feminism is simple. The "patriarchy" does "exist." To identify as a feminist is to acknowledge that<br> women are people, and, as such, women deserve the same social, economic, and political rights<br> and opportunities as other styles of people (i.e., men-people). To be a feminist is also to acknowl-<br>edge that the world is not, currently, a fair and just and safe place for women to exist. Because it <br>is not. Obviously (see: everything ever). To deny these things makes you, at worst, a bad person <br>who hates women, including but not limited to: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jennifer Garner, Jennifer<br> Aniston, Jennifer Lopez, your mother, Jennifer Lopez's mother, Jennifer Garner's Aunt Marcy, Michelle Obama, Ellen DeGeneres, Cher, Julie Andrews, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Kourtney Kar-<br>dashian, Kraken Kardashian, Karphone Kardashian, Kickball Kardashian, Kornkob Kardashian, and THE VIRGIN FUCKING MARY. At best, it makes you a complacent idiot.

            After World War II, women started to be like, "Oh! Maybe I can get a job and tell my husband to <br>stop raping me!" They began taking on subtler forms of sexism and misogynyâ€”things that might<br> not be legally mandated (like voting rights) but were fucking up women's lives nonetheless. <br>These women would become the second-wavers. In 1963, Betty Friedan made everyone go crazy <br>by suggesting that the nuclear family might be a crock of shit that stifled women's potential and<br> made them unhappy. Then sooooooo many things happened!!! Birth control pills, illegalization of <br>marital rape The Equal Rights Amendment did not pass.Women continued to fight, because <br>women are awesome.
